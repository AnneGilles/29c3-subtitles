99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Guten Morgen meine Damen und Herren,

2
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
ich freue mich sehr, dass ich hier bin,

3
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
aber Deutsch ist nicht meine Muttersprache,

4
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
daher werde ich weiter auf englisch sprechen.

5
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Es ist eine Ehre, hier zu sein.

6
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So the Chaos Computer Club to me is like family,

7
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and it is such an honor to be able to speak to everyone here,

8
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and it ridiculous that they asked me to give the keynote.

9
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I hope that I am not wasting 3000 collective hours

10
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
of the smartest people of this planet with what I have to say

11
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
in the next 60 minutes.

12
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I want to start by thanking everyone

13
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
who is in the audience for being here

14
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and for some specific people,

15
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I want to call out Laura Poitress, who is this

16
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
woman here, next to the woman with the camera,

17
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
because she produced and edited that we're going to see

18
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I have been working with her quite a lot

19
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and she is a lot inspirational wonderful artist

20
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
who I love deeply.

21
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And I'd like to start by playing a video,

22
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which is part of an art project we're working on,

23
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
where many people are working on,

24
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and if we could play that first video,

25
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I think that would be a good way to start this off.

26
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Fantastic. So, we have an Idea

27
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
about what my talk will be about, right?

28
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Just in case that there is any question

29
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that I was going to change many horses midstream

30
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
this is a location, it's called Bluffdale, Utah.

31
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And this is one of the largest datacenters

32
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that we know of the NSA is currently constructing.

33
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And there is of course the question about what it is they are trying to build,

34
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
why they're building it,

35
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
what exactly they plan to do with the space and

36
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
how they will use the space

37
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and I am going to talk a bit about this - nice -

38
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and what I am hoping also to point out is, that this is everyones department.

39
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So in this case, what we see, is the construction of the actual bluffdale Utah Site.

40
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So this is the slow process. But there is not anything particular one might object to.

41
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
In this process, it is just construction of a very large building.

42
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And I am gonna read some adresses now that were passed out

43
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
when Winni, Laura and I did a show at the Withney(sp?):

44
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
2651 Olive Street, St. Louis, Missouri, 2563103 United States.

45
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
420 South Grand Los Angeles, California, 90071 United States

46
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
9/11 Folsam Street, San Francisco, California, 94107 United States

47
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
51 Peachtree North<u>Eawst Atlanta Georgia, 3030 United states</u>

48
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
10 South Cannala Chicago Illinois60606 United States

49
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
30 East Street South West Washington DC, 20024 United STates

50
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
811 Tentzh Ave New York, New York, 10019 United States

51
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
12967 Hollenberg Drive, Richtown

52
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Thesse Adresses are potentially Domestic Interception points

53
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
for the NSA in the United States.

54
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
One of them is confirmed accoding to Marc Kline,

55
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
who blew the whistle and discussed the fact

56
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that the NSA is doing domestic surveillance.

57
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I and many of the people believe that the purpose of this datacenter is to build

58
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
something to store and process massive interception

59
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
where some of the calculations by bill binnie,

60
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
who was an analyst for the NSA for almost 40 years

61
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
he thinks, that this center will be used to store the information

62
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
for probably something around 100 years.

63
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And so in theory we might say

64
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that that's not big deal and we have nothing to worry about.

65
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I very much want to make sure that we cover in this talk that's going to happen right now

66
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that this right here is in the back of everyones mind.

67
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
A Datacenter, designed to store things for a 100 years.

68
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That seems like a reasonable theory for this.

69
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and if you read the information that is present about it,

70
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you will in fact see that that seems like it is problably an understatement

71
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and probably, since there is more than a single facility like this,

72
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that there is a possibility that the 100 years is just a short version.

73
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and that's an extremely scary proposition.

74
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, part of the reason I want to show you that is

75
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that I want to lead with that, but I will tell you a quote,

76
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"nothing strengthens the judgement and quickens the conscience like individual responsibility"

77
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which is a quote by a feminist known as Elisabeth Stanton.

78
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This I think is a useful thing when talking about things not being our department.

79
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Because, what do we have to do with the NSA?

80
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What do we have to do with this giant datacenter which is being built in bluffdale?

81
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
well, in essence, part of the thing that is so scary,

82
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that with the internet  and with communication systems as they exist today,

83
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they really isn't a geographical border,

84
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that really changes what we can and can not care about in the ways that we used to.

85
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The fact of the matter is that the NSAs interception,

86
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
those interception points, they will carry not only americans data,

87
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they will carry everyones data for the internet.

88
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, caring about this datacenter is in fact a very serious thing that we need to consider,

89
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
because in fact it does impact everyone.

90
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But even if we didn't use the internet,

91
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
it impacts the people that we care about in a transitive way.

92
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So I'm hoping that in the course of the next 15 minutes

93
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I am able to convice you that these things are your department.

94
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And I of want to start to talk about what Robin Frankin talked about the last few years.

95
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Have any one of you seen these talks that they've given

96
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
such like "We Lost the War"-Talk or "How society might collapse"? See a show of hands for that?

97
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Okay, About half of you.

98
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I want to say that they talked about this and they said we've know we lost the war,

99
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the surveillance state war.

100
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
You know, basically, so many people have decided to

101
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
go to the dark side,so it has been called.

102
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That is working on deep packet inspection, censorship equipment,

103
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Surveillance equipment, Targeting Information etcetera.

104
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This is in fact what has happened.

105
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
If you look at the job that pays very well, that people aware of,

106
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they usually are systems that control types of jobs.

107
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
There are research positions obviously that exists in the world,

108
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but it pays better to work for Lockheed martin that for a university.

109
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So people will choose I think for sometimes good reasons

110
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or understandable reasons to do these types of tasks

111
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and sometimes will even moral arguments saying things like

112
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"because of stuxnet we were able to avoid violence or bombing of a factory".

113
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Of course the reality is that these things are not used alone,

114
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they're used together and in concert with bombings of factories.

115
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, it's certainly worth mentioning, that these guys,

116
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Frankin Robb as well as many other people who did  not stand up and tell

117
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the congress about their ideas

118
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that these people were really on to something.

119
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And unfortunately, now we actually live in the world

120
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that they were describing that was coming. And it's an incredibly scary world.

121
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And in the last few years, I had the misfortune of being targeted

122
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
by a large section of this world. And I can tell you that it's been

123
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
a quite uncomfortable series of days. Just one day after the other

124
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
is the way to take it, or the way to deal with it,

125
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and this is not a comfortable or easy way to live.

126
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
When Frankin Robb talked about this, they still had some kind of hope in their voice,

127
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and I think that is important.

128
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So I wanted to do was to try to take that hope and to focus on it

129
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and to try to take it say that and despite the fact that there are these opressive systems

130
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
of control. And despite the fact that we live now in a surveillance state

131
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that it may still - I think reasonably so - be possible to resist the surveillance state

132
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and to turn things around if we wish.

133
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And I think that there may come a time in which that is not true.

134
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I don't believe that this time has yet arrived.

135
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, Frank wanted me to very much stress this notion that

136
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
we can make this choice about what whe do about our time

137
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that is this notion of the dark and th elight side.

138
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I personally don't think that this sort of black-and-white, white-hat, black-hat, ethics make any sense

139
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
because I don't define my moral and/or ethical framework by making comparison black and white 1950 cowboys movies

140
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and I'd like to say that there are nuances there.

141
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But there are some simple things that you can do to decide

142
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
if you are working on something which is oppressive,

143
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and one of them is to ask yourself if you are working on a system

144
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that helps to control others or

145
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
if you're working on a system that helps to enable others,

146
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to have control over their own lives.

147
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And this is a really simple test.

148
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
If you're working on DPI, that will be deployed on people who do not get a saying in it,

149
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you are probably working for the oppressor.

150
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It's not guaranteed, because there are many of layers of indirection.

151
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Bluecoat probably doesn't think of themselves as being a tool in a military dictatorships toolbox

152
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but the reality is that when the Assad Gouvernment

153
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or the Burmis military dictatorship or their eleged free market companies in Bhurma use bluecoat

154
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which they both do, they have for some time and they will continue to,

155
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
bluecoat is in fact, part of that system of control.

156
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Now, are they responsible?

157
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That's a good question. I don't have an answer to that.

158
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But I do have an answer to wether or not I think they play a role in it.

159
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And that is that they do.

160
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What role, that remains to be seen.

161
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And what I am hopeful about is that some people,

162
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
especially people in this room, have actually made the choice

163
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that is the opposite of that. They've decided to work

164
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
on systems wthat help enable people to be free.

165
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
When for example we see that Mich Altmann from Noisebridge

166
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
has dedicated his life to teaching people about electronics,

167
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and to open hardware and free software,

168
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and we see that he is enabeling people in a positive way.

169
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and this is something that we as a community I think should really step up

170
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
commending people who do this. Bhanny Hueng (sp?) who builds open hardware,

171
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
he is a hero, when  - you can applaud that if you wish -

172
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the thing is, that I probably can't do it,

173
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but I wrote list of names of people that inspired me over breakfast one day,

174
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and it's pretty long, so I'm not gonna read all of it.

175
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But the same is true for Lady Ada, Christine  Corbit(sp?) and amazing people everywherem

176
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
People who dont have names, who are basically anonymous and

177
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
in their community, but we should look to them with pride

178
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
with support and mutual aid and solitaridy.

179
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Because it's not just negative stuff.

180
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Not everybody in here works for FinFisher.

181
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And in fact, more people in here work against FinFisher, thanks for that!

182
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And so, to that end, we can make a choice about what we'd like to do.

183
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And it is possible to make a living making free software for freedom,

184
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
instead of closed source proprietary malware for cops.

185
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But there is a cost to that

186
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
so I want to point out something in this next video,

187
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
where I am going to be be silent while it plays, and it is a minute long.

188
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Speaker: Does the NSA routinely intercept american citizens emails?

189
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
No

190
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Does the NSA intercept americans cell phone conversations?

191
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
No

192
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Google Searches?

193
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
No

194
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Text Messages?

195
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
No

196
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Amazon.com orders?

197
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
no

198
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Bank records?

199
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
No

200
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What judicial consent is required for the NSA to intercept communications and information involving american citizens?

201
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Within the United States, that would be FBI lead,

202
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that was a foreign act within the united states, the FBI would still have the lead

203
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and could work with NSA or other intelligence agencies has authorized.

204
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But to conduct that kind of collection within the United States you would have to go through a court order,

205
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and the court would have to authorize it.

206
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We're not authorized to do it nor do we do it.

207
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
(JA) Well, I think you can all understand the subtext here, which is

208
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that I am protected and you are not.

209
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I bet that makes you feel really great.

210
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So that datacenter we were looking at,

211
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
what he just testified in front of congress about,

212
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that was General Alexander, he is the most powerful person in the world,

213
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
probably even more powerful than the president of the United States,

214
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or any leader of any other country.

215
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
He controls the intelligence structure for the entire NSA and he has ties to the rest of the intelligence community as well.

216
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So what he is basically saying is, that if there is an american - hypothetically in america - they'd probably be fine.

217
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Which does't really make me feel good, because

218
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
there are seven billion people on this planet.

219
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Just a few of them are americans, why should the be treated specially in this regard?

220
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So this giant datacenter that we see, it's for all of you

221
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and it's also for me, because despite the fact that I am an american,

222
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
being associated with Wikileaks is like, well, it's not a good time in America.

223
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, there is a thing to be said here, which is, that,

224
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that guy is a lyer, first of all.

225
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Because we know for a fact, from Marc Kline,

226
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that the NSA was in fact doing dragnet-surveillance of all of those things.

227
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So straight up, this guy is a lyer.

228
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But then on top of being a lyer, which is bad engough in this context,

229
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
he doesn't even bother to pretend that you have any value at all.

230
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And that you have rights.

231
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And that your privacy is important and your human dignity matters,

232
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
becuase of where you happened to be born and

233
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which flag he images you flying.

234
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that to me is very depressing and I feel

235
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
like it actually gives the rest of humanity that lives in america a very bad name.

236
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Anbd so I am very sorry for that.

237
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But I want to talk about some other things, that tie together with that.

238
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
because when we just think about massive surveillance and isolation,

239
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
we will have quite a problem, quite a series of problems in fact,

240
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
so let's talk about some things that all have common ally(sp?) with the surveillance state.

241
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
First of all: data retention and retro-active policing which is clearly a human rights violation in Europe.

242
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It's clearly the case that this type of activity taking place creates suspects out of everyone.

243
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and being a suspect is to already not be free in my experience.

244
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And in fact in the 1800s there was a british author who wrote

245
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"to be free from suspicion is the one of the first freedoms that is important for being free in the rest of your life".

246
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
when you're followed around, when you#re being investigated, because of the whim of someone,

247
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
this is the beginning of the end of your freedom.

248
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, it seems that data retentino is the beginning of the end of many of our freedoms in bulk, and that is a very scary thing.

249
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And when people do retro-active policing, when they apply that lack of freedom in a very specific wy,

250
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and when they take these actions,

251
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they depend on which state you happen to be in, which fiber optics happend to be in  use when your bits were crossing it,

252
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but how does this actually play out?

253
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It depends, right?

254
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And it depends in a very specific sense.

255
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So for example, drone killings, and I am not  just talking about Ironware Lockies(sp?) innocent 16-yearold Son in Jemen,

256
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but drones killings of thousands of people. The targeting information is feed

257
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to the CIA and to other groups from surveillance listening points

258
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
from intelligence factories. So there is a direct relationship

259
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
between surveillance and support of straight-up murder.

260
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That is something which sounds scary, what makes it even scarier is the way these

261
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
drone killings are carried out is that the central comittee that decides who lives and dies

262
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or obamas assasination star chamber, that central committee which sounds to me

263
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
a lot like some of the soviet redaract I remember from my childhood

264
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that central comittee decides non-democratically who gets to be assasinated.

265
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and it is just a hop or two away from surveillance.

266
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So when you assist a surveillance state you are literally helping to kill fucking children.

267
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That is something that doesn't help me sleep at night.

268
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and you can choose not to be part of that; Ialmost every person here has made that choice.

269
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but if you're on the fence I guess you can gzess what I suggest you go.

270
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But there are more ties.

271
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Because let's say drone killing just seem a little bit too far off.

272
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Right? Well, in Uganda, there has been a proposal for some time now,

273
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which seems to be almost pushed back, but not quite,

274
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
where they which to make a death sentence to be a homosexual,

275
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
where aggrevated homosexuality is a crime. I think that is where you continue to flip your wrist.

276
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I am not quite sure what aggrevated homosexuality means.

277
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But this basic notion that someone would be forced to report on you or they would also go to prison,

278
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
this is something which surveillance will impact greatly and it will make a huge difference.

279
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Of course, we can talk about wider things, such as the chinese suppression of the tibetan people,

280
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
we can talk about police backdoors and so-called lawful interception malware

281
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
we can talk about wars on agression in iran and afghanistan,

282
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the surveillance state touches everything,

283
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and it is more than that.

284
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It is the fact that the surveillance state is part of the system of control

285
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that causes much suffering. It may also bring some good things

286
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
into this world, but with the secrecy,

287
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the surveillance state becomes totally unaccountable.

288
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, we can look in some other things that are quite concerning.

289
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We can see that there are ties that are not so obvious.

290
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The military trials of political prisoners in Egypt,

291
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the genocide of the syrian people right now,

292
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the british and swedish justice regarding Julian Assange,

293
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the right-wing Nazis sympathisers here in germany,

294
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that gave Murdering Nazis Passports and Help

295
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and are still not held to account,

296
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the oppresioning crackdown on wikileaks related or WL-tainted people,

297
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
companies that sell equipment to brutal dictatorships and authoritarian regimes,

298
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
for both surveillance and censorships, sometimes both

299
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the reality is that secret police and spying agencies

300
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
actually change our ability to govern ourselves freely.

301
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And they do it in such a way that it is not obvious,

302
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and it is seemingly impossible to resist.

303
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Because these things itself are secret, it becomes extremely difficult to know

304
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
where to begin resisting.

305
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Add it's core, in the United States, where this has gone,

306
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
is that there are secret laws, with secret interpretations, and a total lack of accountability.

307
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And fundamentally, what these things are, is that they are oppressive, vainguarded approaches,

308
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to authoritanianism, they are insultingly paternalistic and allegedly above the law.

309
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
If you ever had the opportunity to meet the people that work in these intelligence agencies that are still there,

310
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
some of them are quite good, they're fundamentally awesome people.

311
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But when it comes to their job, they're in a pretty terrible place.

312
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That is if they wish to keep their job they are not really free to descent.

313
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
If we look at people, for example like Bill Binnie or Thomas Drake, what  we see is

314
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that when you descent, you'll get crushed.

315
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Your Family Life will be ruined,

316
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
there are huge costs to telling the truth.

317
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And there are huge costs for asking for a more just system.

318
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Bill Binnie blow my mind in a very peticular way.

319
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I thought surely a way working for the NSA for 40 years, we wouldn't have a lot in comon.

320
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But it turns out, that he said to me that he thought that the spying was actually an immoral things,

321
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but that maybe during the cold war it was a necessary evil.

322
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That is he thought that maybe they could prevent total atomic warfare.

323
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And at the same time he recognised that it was not the right thing to spy on people.

324
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that this should not be the end in itself.

325
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I was really touched by that, because

326
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
usually it is the case that someone would say

327
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"except for americans. you can spy on everyone but not on americans."

328
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And for him the turning point was that he decided that it was wrong to spy on everybody.

329
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And when they decided to spy on americans, it was clear

330
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that they couldn't be trusted to spy even on any single person

331
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and to do it in a way which would be producing justice.

332
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That was very surprising for me. It actually made me change my mind about the people working for the NSA.

333
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but then it turns out that he suffered a great deal for having that opinion.

334
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So maybe it doesn't change my mind that much about the people who are still there.

335
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But, fundamentally, human rights, in theory, should be something that we can work for collectively.

336
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And yet it doesn't really seem that is happening.

337
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
There is a lot of rhetoric about it.

338
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But when you kill hundreds of thousand people it is very difficult

339
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to talk about the benefits of technologies in a way that doesn't seem like grouping.

340
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, it happens that we develop these psychological defenses to it, so

341
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
half of the people I met and discussed this with,

342
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
when this is the first time they considered the surveillance state,

343
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they talk about it in terms of their initial reaction what they put it in five minuts of thought, like

344
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"it doesn't concern me".

345
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Or "it won't impact me". In fact the only people who are getting it,

346
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
are people who deserve it."

347
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you know they are under a legitimate investigatoin.

348
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That actually shows what a legitimate investigation is,

349
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
when you can't hold people to account when there are secret laws, they rule

350
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
by-law and rule of-law is not the same thing. Rule-by-drecree doesn't mean it is just, simply because it is written down,

351
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
especially if the interpretation is secret.

352
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, After people recognise that it may impact them,

353
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
there is a fantastic set f things that takes place,

354
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and one of them is that people will try to minimize their role in it,

355
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
saying lines like "well, it won't be possible to sort me out or find me in this massive data set"

356
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or "even if I do stand down, nothing will happen to me".

357
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And if they happen to be as unlucky as I have been in the last few years,

358
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
they'll say something like "well, the system works and no unjustice will occure, because this state is benign."

359
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That are not many people who I met who have gotten to that stage who actually continue to think that for that long.

360
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
it  might be worth considering that perhaps we have to get to that point,

361
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
to recognize that there is great foldey in that set of thougts and plan to thinking that.

362
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It might be the case that the surveillance state that exists

363
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
in fact is negative even if we do not yet understand fully its negative effects.

364
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, you see thois also as social defense groups,

365
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
as a reaction, I think probably the split between wikileaks and openleaks is the greatest

366
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
example of the fact that groups, even effective groups, will split and then have bad blood

367
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and then in fact they will deliver other failure, and it is very sad, tragic even,

368
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and this kind of stuff is something which, even trying to resist,

369
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that we aren't quite aware how these types of things happen.

370
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
History shows us certain ways how these splits might occur.

371
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Biut it isn't the case that we fully grocked this historical lessons

372
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
so it is quite sad that we focus so much of our energy on degrading things,

373
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
like something does a great thing and someone sais "Ah yes, but this one thing"

374
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and the discussion becomes about this one thing.

375
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I think in fact it might make sense to focus on the good things

376
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
as well, it is true that sometimes people produce free hardware but it has one binary BLOB

377
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that does not mean that we should not thank this person and give him credit,

378
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
in fact to really praise them foir putting so much effort to make everything as open as possible

379
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and it's too bad one thing is not open, but maybe we could put in some effort to open up and free that one thing.

380
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It is basically the same statement, but the way it is stated allows us to think of it in being in it together.

381
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And it helps to keep people together, and it helps keeping people motivated to work together in fact.

382
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I think, it is a useful idea, to try to take this tact.

383
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We also have these psyhcological defenses about the ühysical world, which I have experienced quite a lot.

384
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
For example, that notion that warrants are required to enter your house.

385
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Your physical location is somehow protected is a very quite notion I certainly don't believe that anymore.

386
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
it is a little sad, but it doesn't seem to be the case.

387
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
In the United States, there is a thing called the Patriot Act,

388
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and section 2.15 of the Patriot act essentially sais

389
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"Something" and it's interpreted completely differently.

390
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that is there is a secret interpretation of section 2.15 of the Patriot Act,

391
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and if you ask Bill Binnie about this, what he would say is that everything is fair game.

392
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That is to say, regardless what you thought, the constitution said

393
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
(regardless what you think the united nations declaration of human right sais)

394
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that's not what is really going on.

395
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And so, this defense that the people have, they're journalist, they're protected,

396
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
no one will do anything to them, it's nonsense.

397
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Every Journalist in the United States who is subject to the warrantless wiretapping tentacles,

398
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
is being surveilled, regardless of the journalistic protections.

399
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Every member of congress, everybody in this room, probably especially everyone in this room.

400
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And of course people will say "You know, don't cross the border with something".

401
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That's so stupid, so for example, when I cross the border with a telephone,

402
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I am actually not allowed to tell you what happened to my telephones. And obviously,

403
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
it was a mistake to cross the border with a telephone,

404
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
it wasn't so much of a mistake, because the telephone connects to the telephone system,

405
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and every telephone number on that telephone  had been used to make or receive calls,

406
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
so it's not like the data wasn't already in the hands of the oppressor.

407
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It was just the case of slightly better indexed.

408
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But it also had some extra numbers in there, just for fun.

409
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I mean, if you're going to have a surveillance state,

410
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that is going to make people guilt for association,

411
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
you might want to make sure that there are some jerks in your phoneboon, right?

412
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But the reality is, well, I can cross the border without anything of consequence

413
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that is,m me deciding to become subdued, and it is me, deciding to except the oppression.

414
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And everyone here can make that choice,

415
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But I say "Fuck that! That is not a choice we should make!"

416
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That's in fact a coping mechanism, and these kinds of coping mechanisms

417
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
are a responsive a lack of agency, a response of total helplessness.

418
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
For example, people run throigh their mind, "How will I eat, How will I feed my children"

419
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
"HOw will I educate them if I don't play along, if I don't comply?"

420
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
They'll make my life hell".

421
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Part of the problem here, and it is funny to say it here in Europe,

422
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
becuase it has a much different context,

423
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
part of the problem here is the state.

424
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
When the state has the power make you make those kinds of thoughrts appear in your head,

425
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and it allows you to create that, and make those choices, we become less free.

426
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And maybe, recognizing those coping mechanisms and trying to progress to the next one,

427
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
trying to progress to the next thought could be helpful.

428
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I think that it is helpful.

429
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
For me, and what I have tried to do is that I have tried to recognize that

430
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I am trying to cope with a situation that is impossible to cope with.

431
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
there is really nothing quite going your night like feeling an entire State is stepping on your throat.

432
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
It is not even great at talking about on parties.

433
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I mean, there is not really much that is good about it.

434
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But, there is some good that can come of it. And that is to show other people that it is not total.

435
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
That it does not nearly end in tears. It might, but it doiesn'Ät every single day.

436
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
You have to choose how this goes.

437
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I had the oppoertunity to meet the dalai lama in India,

438
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
about two weeks ago, and to me, the tibetan people who had escaped from tibet

439
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
under the opperssive chinese rule, people who had been shot, their stomachs ripped out,

440
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
there skull cracked open, their teeth knocked out, their families jailes, you name it, they experienced it.

441
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And I realized, I had no problems. By comparison especially, but I recognized something:

442
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
these are the friendlies, niciest people you can imagine. I mean, it is really quite a touching thing,

443
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
despite the fact, that about a hundred years ago they were a brutal theocracy, they have quite learned since then.

444
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And it is the case, that we can decide how it is we cope with these things.

445
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We can become increasingly cold and atomized, we can become destroyed, we can undermine our communities,

447
99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000

99:59:59,000 --> 99:59:59,000
