29C3 - NOT MY DEPARTMENT - SUBTITLES
====================================

This is a test - we want to see whether we can add subtitles to our talks. The whole effort is organized in [29C3 Wiki/Subtitles](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/wiki/Subtitles), feel free to contribute a few minutes of transcripts.

A good tool fort that is http://www.universalsubtitles.org/ where most of us do their work.

All subtitles must be contributed with no strings attached. These subs are licensed under the same [Creative Commons 3.0 By](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0) License as the original talks.
